# BUBBLE GAME

In this project I have tried to make a bubble game. I have used my html, css and some basic knowledge of JS. 


The game is pretty simple. You get 60 seconds and a number will appear as hit and you will have to click the bubble with the same number among the many bubbles in the playing area. for every correct hit you get 10 score and has no negative scoring. 

with every correct hit the hit number and the numbers in the playground area gets changed and a new randomly generated number appears everywhere replacing the previous one.
